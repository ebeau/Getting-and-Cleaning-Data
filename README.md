Week 3 Course Project
Getting and Cleaning Data, Coursera.org
===================================================

This is a course project for the class 'Getting and Cleaning Data'.  The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.   The original dataset may be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.


The resulting dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md': Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

- 'CodeBook.md': Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data.

- 'run_analysis.R': Shows the transformations and the clean-up work. Upon running, it produces tidy.txt and tidy_mean.txt.



The R script was created using:
	* platform       x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
	* arch           x86_64 
	* os             linux-gnu
	* system         x86_64, linux-gnu
	* R version      3.1.0 (2014-04-10)
